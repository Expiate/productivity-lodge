## Lessons Learned

This is my DAM graduation project.

I learned a lot about web development, I didn't know anything about the web and its technologies and now
I'm only getting more and more interested about it.

I learned how to create and use a Restfull API. How to structure and style HTML code using SCSS. How to use JavaScript and TypeScript.
Took my firsts steps into cryptography. How to integrate Async Code. I also learned a lot about unit and integration testing. How to use Control Version in a real project. And so many things I could not write them all.
